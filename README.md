 # Streamlit Demo: The Udacity Self-driving Car Image Browser

This project demonstrates the [Udacity self-driving-car dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car) and [YOLO object detection](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo) into an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app. This project is based on the publicly available [Streamlit Udacity borswer demo](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving/tree/master).

## Assignment steps
* Prepare an environment and run the app:
    * As done in the first assignment, clone this repo in the "GitClass" folder ("C:\Users\%yourUsername%\Visual Studio Code\GitClass"); you should then have the project folder named "streamlit-yolo-demo" in the "GitClass" folder
    * In a terminal window, go into the project folder: ```cd %yourProjectFolder%```
    * Create a Python virtual env: ```python -m venv porini-gitclass-env```
    * Activate the new virtual env: ```"porini-gitclass-env/Scripts/activate.bat"```
    * Install requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    * Run the app: ```streamlit run main.py```
    * After verifying that it works, stop the app
* Create a new branch, update the code and merge the updated code to the "main" branch:
    * Create a new branch: ```git branch develop```
    * Check that the current branch is "develop": ```git branch```
    * #TODO: do code changes
    * Commit and push your changes to the "develop" branch
    * From the browser, open the repository, go to the "develop" branch and create a pull request to merge you changes to the "main" branch: complete it to align "main" to "develop"
    * From your local project, go to the "main" branch and pull the changes applied by the pull request you completed: in this way, your local project is aligned with the "main" from the remote
